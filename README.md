## Usage

`python3 train.py`  downloads the MNIST dataset to ./data/mnist and train the DRAW model with attention for both reading and writing. After training, the weights files are written to ./save/weights_final.tar and the generated images are written to ./image/.png

`python3 generate.py`	 loads wieghts from save/weights_final.tar  and generates images

The weights_final.tar file is trained for 50 epoch with minibatch size 64 on GTX 1080 GPU.
